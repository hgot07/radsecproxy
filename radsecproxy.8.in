.SH "NAME"
radsecproxy - a generic RADIUS proxy that provides both RADIUS UDP and TCP/TLS (RadSec) transport.

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
radsecproxy is a \fBgeneric RADIUS proxy\fR that in addition to to
usual \fBRADIUS UDP\fR transport, also supports \fBTLS (RadSec)\fR. The
aim is for the proxy to have sufficient features to be flexible,
while at the same time to be small, efficient and easy to configure.

The proxy was initially made to be able to deploy \fBRadSec\fR (RADIUS
over TLS) so that all RADIUS communication across network links
could be done using TLS, without modifying existing RADIUS software.
This can be done by running this proxy on the same host as an existing
RADIUS server or client, and configure the existing client/server to
talk to localhost (the proxy) rather than other clients and servers
directly.

There are however other situations where a RADIUS proxy might be
useful. Some people deploy RADIUS topologies where they want to
route RADIUS messages to the right server. The nodes that do purely
routing could be using a proxy. Some people may also wish to deploy
a proxy on a site boundary. Since the proxy \fBsupports both IPv4
and IPv6\fR, it could also be used to allow communication in cases
where some RADIUS nodes use only IPv4 and some only IPv6.

.SH "OPTIONS"
.TP
.B \-f
Run in foreground.
.br
By specifying this option, the proxy will run in foreground mode. That
is, it won't detach. Also all logging will be done to stderr.

.TP
.B \-d \fIdebuglevel\fR
This specifies the debug level. It must be set to 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5, where
1 logs only serious errors, and 5 logs everything. The default is 2 which
logs errors, warnings and a few informational messages.

.TP
.B \-p
Pretend
.br
The proxy reads configuration files and performs initialisation as
usual, but exits prior to creating any sockets. It will return different
exit codes depending on whether the configuration files are okay. This
may be used to verify configuration files, and can be done while another
instance is running.

.TP
.B \-v
Print version and exit.

.TP
.B \-c \fIconfigfile\fR
This option allows you to specify which config file to use. This is useful
if you want to use a config file that is not in any of the default locations.

.TP
.B \-i \fIpidfile\fR
This option tells the proxy to create a PID file with the specified path.

.SH "SIGNALS"
The proxy generally exits on all signals. The exceptions are listed below.

.TP
.B SIGHUP
.br
When logging to a file, this signal forces a reopen of the log file.
.br
When using TLS or DTLS, reload certificate CRLs.

.TP
.B SIGPIPE
.br
This signal is ignored.

.SH "FILES"
.TP
.B @SYSCONFDIR@/radsecproxy.conf
.sp
The default configuration file.
